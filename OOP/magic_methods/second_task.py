# Create a hierarchy out of birds. Implement 4 classes:
#
# class Bird with an attribute name and methods fly and walk.
# class FlyingBird with attributes name, ration, and with the same methods. ration must have a default value. Implement the method eat which will describe its typical ration.
# class NonFlyingBird with same characteristics but which obviously without attribute fly. Add the same "eat" method but with other implementation regarding the swimming bird tastes.
# class SuperBird which can do all of it: walk, fly, swim and eat. But be careful which "eat" method you inherit.
# Implement str() function call for each class.
